# Haskell solutions for 2015 Java course

This repo will contain Haskell solutions for exercises from Freiburg
University's Java programming course (edition summer term 2015). Each exercise
I could be bothered to solve can be found in the corresponding folder
(`exXX_Y/` for sheet `XX`, exercise `Y`). The code is always in `src/`; the
rest is Haskell-specific scaffolding. If you're interested in build
instructions or further information, please contact me directly.

Some directories contain solutions for multiple exercises (e.g. ex05\_3
contains ex05\_2 and ex05\_3).
