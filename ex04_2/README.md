The solution for these exercises is much too complex for my tastes, but I don't
have any good ideas on how to make it more palatable. It seems like the
business logic is too monolithic to separate into meaningful individual Autos,
but maybe my imagination is just lacking in this regard. In any case, this is
one area where I'll have to concede victory to Java. The OO model is just
really well suited to this kind of inherently stateful thing.
